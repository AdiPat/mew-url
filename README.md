# Mew URL

An Open Source, production-grade URL shortening service written in TypeScript.

## Inspiration

There are many URL shortening services available, but thereâ€™s a lack of quality FOSS (Free & Open Source) options for production use. Mew URL addresses this need by providing a fully free, Open Source URL shortening service that can be self-hosted, deployed, and configured to meet the requirements of your project.

## Features

- **Open Source**: Full access to the source code. Clone and integrate into existing TypeScript projects or run as a standalone service.
- **Self-Hosted**: Easily deploy the service on your infrastructure with provided deployment instructions.
- **Customizable Database**: Plug the service into database system of your choice. Currently supports Postgres and MongoDB. 
- **Analytics**: Gain insights into usage with analytics on the generated URLs.
- **Customizable URLs**: Create short, memorable URLs with custom slugs.
- **Expiration Controls**: Set expiration dates for URLs to control access over time.
- **Secure**: Configurable security options, including password protection for short URLs.
- **Scalable**: Built to handle high traffic with minimal setup, making it ideal for production environments.
- **Admin Panel**: Web interface for managing and monitoring shortened URLs and usage statistics.
- **API Support**: RESTful API endpoints for accessing Mew URL features.
- **Easy Integration**: Easily integrate Mew URL into your existing codebase with the client library.
